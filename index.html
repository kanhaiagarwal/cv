      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="description">
        I am an experienced Software Developer / Solutions Architect who has gained good experience by working in an MNC
        like Amazon for 3.5 years, running his own startup as CTO in Fosho TV, and doing seasoned Freelancing in his
        spare time.
        Writing code has come naturally to me since a PC was installed at my home in my 5th Grade. I chose CSE from a
        socially perceived average college rather than pursuing any other degree from a socially perceived reputed
        college.
        This is baecause I like to study more about things that I like and think will give me satisfaction at the end of
        the day.
        I like watching as well as playing sports. I am an avid Manchester United and Real Madrid fan. Cooking has never
        been my cup of tea. Rather I like to taste and give constructive reviews(if you know what I mean).
        I am always on a lookout for working on something which really challenges my skills and in returns makes me more
        skillful than before.
