                <p>
                    I am a 2016 B.Tech CSE Graduate from JIIT Noida. I
                    started my career straight from a tech giant called
                    Amazon Development Center. After spending a very nice
                    and eventful 3.5 years there, starting as an Application
                    Engineer, and then an SDE-T, I tried running my own
                    startup called Fosho TV. My own startup gave me a very
                    enriching and learning experience which has made me more
                    mature as a Software Developer and as a person in
                    general. Now I am working full time as a Software
                    Engineer in a Travel Management startup called
                    Travelstop. I also do occasional Freelancing to try out
                    some new skills apart from work and spend quality time
                    with code even away from the office.
